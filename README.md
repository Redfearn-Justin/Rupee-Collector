### Project Insight

This is an unsung portion of The Legend Of Zelda. It seems that Link has somehow managed to lose all his Rupees! This is where *you* come in. In this application, it is your goal to collect the specified amount of Rupees Link had. However, Link has suffered amnesia and doesn't recall what which Rupee is worth: so each Rupee is given a random value between 1-12. Over shoot the total? You lose the game, the game will automatically refresh, and all Rupees will be given random values. Get the total? Great job! The game will refresh, and the Rupees will be given a new random value again.

### Technologies Utilized

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery

### Instructions

* Using the Rupee buttons, the player attempts to perfectly match the "Crystals to Collect" amount shown

* The player wins if they match the aforementioned number; the player loses if they exceed that very same number

**Conditionals**:

* All numbers are randomly generated, with the Rupee being assigned numbers anywhere between 1-12, and the "Crystals To Collect" number being anywhere between 19-120.

* The random numbers assigned to the Rupees aren't shown

* The player doesn't need to refresh the browser to keep playing; the game will refresh by itself.
